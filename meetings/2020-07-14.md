* Dependents tooling [#327](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/327)
  * Making progress a few PRs integrated for Wiby
  * PR open in dependents as well


* PkgJS Org for WG supported tooling [#271](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/271)
  * Next step
    * is to determine and configure the administrative members
    * transfer to the Node.js project 


* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * Michael to see if we can work around dependency that does not support 8.X
  * Write up blog promoting recommending support, along with references to the tool


* CI/CD ideas and collective suggestions before we start [#340](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/340)
  * Glen, we should have good example
  * Thinking of using Github actions
  * Dominikas, very basic concepts don’t need to go into detail, just reference external stuff
    or assume its understood.  Bit tricky to provide examples of Node.js packages as 
    CD ends at publish to npm.
  * Owen should we target a slice of the audience (for example those new to publishing
    modules, versus advanced developers)
  * Glenn, make sense.
  * Can use pkgjs org to show examples for other areas like test as well.
   
### nodejs/ci-config-travis


* Repo layout bikeshed [#5](https://github.com/nodejs/ci-config-travis/issues/5)

### Package maintenance session in the collab summit


* Common themes, need to get enterprise engagement going, in summit talking to the
