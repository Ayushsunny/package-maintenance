## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No announcements this week


### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Suggest ignoring a vulnerability by the package maintainer [#386](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/386)
  * Jordan , Snyk seems interested, historically npm has pushed back

  * concern on possibility of incorrect application of the “does not apply”
  * Need enthusiastic stakeholders to help solve the difficult issue.
  * Maybe @MylesBorins, @darcyclarke, @lirantal to see if there is any opportunity to work together on the issue.
  * maybe @isaacs and @wesleytodd too as they were the ones suggesting to involve this group.

* Defining / documenting a process for Requests For Help (RFH) [#372](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/372)
  * already landed. Don’t need to discuss further.

* PkgJS Org for WG supported tooling [#271](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/271)
  * proposed initial set of administrative members  https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/390
  * Next step will then be to audit the current repos to make sure we have licences etc and them
    move over to Node.js project.

* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * once doc lands should be ready for blog to promote, ask maintainers to add.
 
* suggested modules from PkgJS that would benefit from CI/CD implementation via GitHub actions for hard case examples is 
[#340](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/340)
  * Glenn has cases that he is working on for Express, if we choose our own modules,
    would be good to show them doing it.
  * Dominykas we have a number and could do any one of those. Detect node support
    could use some examples. Should look at next step as well as how to build out github ci
    action.

* Testing doc final review
[#377](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/377)
  * Pretty much ready to land.

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).
