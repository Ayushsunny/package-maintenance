### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Building `create-pkg` [#404](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/404)
  * create-pkg ownership transferred to the @pkgjs org on npmjs.com.
  * npm uses create-x as identifier as template. Therefore npm init pkg runs that package.
  * we can use to create some good defaults
  * repo https://github.com/pkgjs/create will be used to build this out.
    * had been used to scaffold out an earlier version
    * need to delete/move code somewhere else and then use this repo to build out the package as
      outlined in the issue.
  * the list shown is a superset of the defaults used by current npm default init
  * Next steps:
    * out of band call on technical structure etc. Wes will set up through issue after call.
    * get some general consensus of the approach we'd like to take building this & the
       defaults we'd want
    * update @pkgjs/support to be a consumer of this tool or vice-versa
