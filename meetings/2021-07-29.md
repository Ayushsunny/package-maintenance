### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * Wes has moved the repo over
  * Have seen a lot off different ways to scaffold projects
  * [Scope for create package project](https://github.com/pkgjs/create/issues/9)
  * [How to decompose domains of the create package project](https://github.com/pkgjs/create/issues/7)
  * In past, request for changes/extensions to npm init
    * package maintenance team could provide good defaults. One key goal is to move
      towards instead of running npm init, run npm init pkg which would run the
      create-pkg module to do the initialization.
  * should have directory of examples, have tests output one of every variant then do
    snapshot testing.
  * darcy has create-pkg, repo is <https://github.com/pkgjs/create>
* Main current state is not merged yet. For create-package-json you need to look at 1.x
  branch - <https://github.com/pkgjs/create-package-json/tree/1.x>

* One good next step is to
  * Some cleanup/validation of what is in pkgks/create, does not necessarily need to be MVP
    functionality
  * Go through publish cycle (will need Darcy to help add people who can publish)
* Other key step is to rename default branch to main, add required contributing, etc. docs.

* Suggested list of modules to help get support info into [#413](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/413)
  * no update

* Owen, working on side project and looking at export maps.
  * Is it safe to say as far as Node.js is concerned does it just come down to main
    and exports or some of the other fields used in the ecosystem important.
    * Wes only using main, trying to keep things simple, too many footguns with others
    * No npm spec package.json

* Jon, went through and triaged a number of issues
  * created new label stale?
  * closed a few issues

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits)

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.
