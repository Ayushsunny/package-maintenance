## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Tierney discussed the latest status of [NPM assertions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/422) that can address desired vulnerability management support for package maintainers (CVEs, dependabot alerts, SNYK, etc).  Good opportunity for this group to help share and promote an effort that came out of discussions within this group.

* Tierney gave an update on on a proof of concept for [a licence auditing / enforcement tool](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/182) that they had been working on with the NPM CLI team

* Status update and next steps for "pkgjs/create" (create-pkg) [#458](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/458)
  * We have the needed pieces in the pkg repos, but don’t think we’ve made progress
  * We don’t have Jon who was last looking at it, so no update this time.

* Suggested list of modules to help get support info into [#413](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/413)
  * No update this week.
  * Will comment in the issue to see if there are any more outstanding action items left

* draft documentation promotion [#373](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/373)
  * Dependency management issue now checked off as it had been merged recently
  * No other updates aside from that, but suggested this could be a good issue to use to help promote OSS via [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) that starts tomorrow (just needs appropriate labeling of issues)

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits)14

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1)  and necessary changes if time permits.
